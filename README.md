# How can I respring after I apply the changes?
Unfortunately, there isn't an easy way to do this yet. Here are three methods:

**Method 1: RespringApp**
1. Download [this .ipa](https://github.com/C4ndyF1sh/ZeroCalories/raw/refs/heads/main/respringapp.ipa).
2. Install it via [SideStore](https://sidestore.io), [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or a other .ipa installation way (LiveContainer does **NOT** work with this).
3. Open the newly installed App.

**Method 2: Display & Text Size**
1. Before applying the tweaks, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom
2. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.
3. After, apply the tweaks.
4. Go back into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom
5. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.

**Method 3: Language & Region**
1. Apply the tweaks.
2. Go into Settings > General > Language & Region
3. Click "Add language..."
4. Choose any language.
5. A popup will appear asking you to change your primary language. **Please select the language that you were using before.**
